        The contemporary digital landscape is awash with solicitations of various kinds vying ceaselessly for eyeballs
        and fingertips. As the twenty first century whirls onward, many have found it difficult to stake a **no
        soliciting** sign down into the bedrock of clickbait journalism and hyperlinked comments that make up the front
        yards of their Instagram feeds. How much of this uninvited visual information slips past our conscious awareness
        and into our background streams? Who is controlling it, and what do they want? In any case, the option to press
        ‘x’ in the corner of a web advertisement or the choice of whether or not to accept an airdropped file that is
        already shown on screen is a bit like being asked, “Can I ask you a question?” There is not much choice at all.
        <br><br>The artists and designers of Unsolicited Airdrop take pride in engaging within this space of visual combat. We
        invite you to look critically and think skeptically about this presented body of artworks as airdrops.
        Furthermore, much like the contents of an airdrop, which often include items ranging from smart bombs to
        humanitarian aid, transmission of content to specific places and locations is of the utmost importance. This
        show is being presented in a specific place at a specific time, and the artists would like to recognize and
        respect this fact. To encourage engagement with bodies in physical space and specific instances, certain
        exhibition materials will only be made available via airdrop to those who attend the show in person.
